Title: Primality Test | Set 2 (Fermat Method)

Subject: 
Given a number n, check if it is prime or not. We have introduced and discussed the School method for primality testing in Set 1.
Primality Test | Set 1 (Introduction and School Method)
In this post, Fermat’s method is discussed. This method is a probabilistic method and is based on Fermat’s Little Theorem.

Example:
Fermat's Little Theorem:
If n is a prime number, then for every a, 1 < a < n-1,

an-1 ≡ 1 (mod n)
 OR 
an-1 % n = 1 
 

Example: Since 5 is prime, 24 ≡ 1 (mod 5) [or 24%5 = 1],
         34 ≡ 1 (mod 5) and 44 ≡ 1 (mod 5) 

         Since 7 is prime, 26 ≡ 1 (mod 7),
         36 ≡ 1 (mod 7), 46 ≡ 1 (mod 7) 
         56 ≡ 1 (mod 7) and 66 ≡ 1 (mod 7)
