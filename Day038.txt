Subject: An array consisting of N integers is given. There are several Right Circular Rotations of range[L..R] that we perform. After performing these rotations, we need to find element at a given index.

Input : arr[] : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        ranges[] = { {0, 2}, {0, 3} }
        index : 1
Output : 3
Explanation : After first given rotation {0, 2}
                arr[] = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5}
              After second rotation {0, 3} 
                arr[] = {4, 3, 1, 2, 5}
After all rotations we have element 3 at given
index 1.
