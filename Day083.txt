Title: Find Next Sparse Number

Subject:
A number is Sparse if there are no two adjacent 1s in its binary representation. For example 5 (binary representation: 101) is sparse, but 6 (binary representation: 110) is not sparse. 
Given a number x, find the smallest Sparse number which greater than or equal to x.

Example:
Input: x = 6
Output: Next Sparse Number is 8

Input: x = 4
Output: Next Sparse Number is 4

Input: x = 38
Output: Next Sparse Number is 40

Input: x = 44
Output: Next Sparse Number is 64
