Title: Sieve of Eratosthenes

Subject: 
Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. It is also given that n is a small number. 

Example: 
Input : n =10
Output : 2 3 5 7 

Input : n = 20 
Output: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million or so (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes.
