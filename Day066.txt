Title: Print Nodes in Top View of Binary Tree

Subject: 
Top view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the top. Given a binary tree, print the top view of it. The output nodes can be printed in any order.

A node x is there in output if x is the topmost node at its horizontal distance. Horizontal distance of left child of a node x is equal to horizontal distance of x minus 1, and that of right child is horizontal distance of x plus 1. 

Example:
       1
    /     \
   2       3
  /  \    / \
 4    5  6   7
Top view of the above binary tree is
4 2 1 3 7
