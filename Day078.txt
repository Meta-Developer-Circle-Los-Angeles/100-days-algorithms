Title: Sum of bit differences among all pairs

Subkect:
Given an integer array of n integers, find sum of bit differences in all pairs that can be formed from array elements. Bit difference of a pair (x, y) is count of different bits at same positions in binary representations of x and y. 

For example, bit difference for 2 and 7 is 2. Binary representation of 2 is 010 and 7 is 111 ( first and last bits differ in two numbers).

Example:
Input: arr[] = {1, 2}
Output: 4
All pairs in array are (1, 1), (1, 2)
                       (2, 1), (2, 2)
Sum of bit differences = 0 + 2 +
                         2 + 0
                      = 4

Input:  arr[] = {1, 3, 5}
Output: 8
All pairs in array are (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5)
                       (3, 1), (3, 3) (3, 5),
                       (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Sum of bit differences =  0 + 1 + 1 +
                          1 + 0 + 2 +
                          1 + 2 + 0 
                       = 8
