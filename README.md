Los Angeles Meta Developer Circle - 100 Days Algorithms

## Welcome to 100 days of algorithms

The goal is to create a community to motivate each other on a daily basis to stay focus and to improve your algorithm/data structure skills that represent the foundation of any programming language.

For 100 days, i will push 1 exercise every day
The next day i will push the answer for the previous day and 1 new exercise 

1. Choose a programming language
2. Review basic of your favorite programming language
3. Clone repository to your local machine
4. Create a branch with your name
5. Every day, commit your code of the day, for example day 1 will have commig `d01`
6. Push your code to your branch
7. share your daily progress on the developer circle page

## Tips
- make a personal commitment every day for about 1 to 3 hours
- don't look at answer on internet
- don't use any IDE, use a command line if possible 
- push your code even if you didn't finish your exercise
- don't push to master, only on your branch

## Keep in mind
- you will be overwhelmed with so many questions and you will face a lot of difficulty in solving the problems. It’s okay if you take more time in solving the questions but don’t be discouraged. 
- If you’re a beginner then try to commit at least 4-6 hours every day
- If you’re an experienced try to commit for 2-3 hours every day
- Try to solve the problems on your own first even if it takes a couple of more hours. After spending many hours if you don’t get the solution then you can stretch yourself for a few days or take the hints. As you will progress you will see improvement in yourself and also you will take less time in solving the questions.
