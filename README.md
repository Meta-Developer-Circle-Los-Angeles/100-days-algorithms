Los Angeles Meta Developer Circle - 100 Days Algorithms

## Welcome to 100 days of algorithms

The goal is to create a community to motivate each other on a daily basis to stay focus and to improve your algorithm/data structure skills that represent the foundation of any programming language.

For 100 days, i will push 1 exercise every day
The next day i will push the answer for the previous day and 1 new exercise 

1. Choose a programming language
2. Review basic of your favorite programming language
3. Clone repository to your local machine
4. Create a branch with your name
5. Every day, commit your code of the day, for example day 1 will have commig `d01`
6. Push your code to your branch
7. share your daily progress on the developer circle page

## Tips
- make a personal commitment every day for about 1 to 3 hours
- don't look at answer on internet
- don't use any IDE, use a command line if possible 
- push your code even if you didn't finish your exercise
- don't push to master, only on your branch
