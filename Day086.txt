Title: Generate all possible sorted arrays from alternate elements of two given sorted arrays

Subject: 
Given two sorted arrays A and B, generate all possible arrays such that first element is taken from A then from B then from A and so on in increasing order till the arrays exhausted. The generated arrays should end with an element from B.

Example:
A = {10, 15, 25}
B = {1, 5, 20, 30}

The resulting arrays are:
  10 20
  10 20 25 30
  10 30
  15 20
  15 20 25 30
  15 30
  25 30
