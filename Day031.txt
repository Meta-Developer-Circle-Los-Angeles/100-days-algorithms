Subject:
Consider an array arr of distinct numbers sorted in increasing order. Given that this array has been rotated (clockwise) k number of times. Given such an array, find the value of k.


Example:
Input: arr[] = {15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12}
Output: 2
Explanation: Initial array must be {2, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18}. We get the given array after rotating the initial array twice.

Input: arr[] = {7, 9, 11, 12, 5}
Output: 4

Input: arr[] = {7, 9, 11, 12, 15};
Output: 0
