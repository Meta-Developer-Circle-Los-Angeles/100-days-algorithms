Given an array, only rotation operation is allowed on array. We can rotate the array as many times as we want. Return the maximum possible summation of i*arr[i].

Example:
Input: arr[] = {1, 20, 2, 10}
Output: 72
We can get 72 by rotating array twice.
{2, 10, 1, 20}
20*3 + 1*2 + 10*1 + 2*0 = 72

Input: arr[] = {10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Output: 330
We can get 330 by rotating array 9 times.
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
0*1 + 1*2 + 2*3 ... 9*10 = 330
