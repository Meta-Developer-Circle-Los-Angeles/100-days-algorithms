Title: Count number of bits to be flipped to convert A to B

Subject:
Given two numbers ‘a’ and b’. Write a program to count number of bits needed to be flipped to convert ‘a’ to ‘b’. 

Example:
Input : a = 10, b = 20
Output : 4
Binary representation of a is 00001010
Binary representation of b is 00010100
We need to flip highlighted four bits in a
to make it b.

Input : a = 7, b = 10
Output : 3
Binary representation of a is 00000111
Binary representation of b is 00001010
We need to flip highlighted three bits in a
to make it b.
