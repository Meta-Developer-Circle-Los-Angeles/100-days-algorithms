Title: Move all zeroes to end of array | Set-2 (Using single traversal)

Subject: Given an array of n numbers. The problem is to move all the 0â€™s to the end of the array while maintaining the order of the other elements. Only single traversal of the array is required.

Example:
Input : arr[]  = {1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6}
Output : 1 2 3 6 0 0 0

Input: arr[] = {0, 1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0, 9}
Output: 1 9 8 4 2 7 6 9 0 0 0 0 0
