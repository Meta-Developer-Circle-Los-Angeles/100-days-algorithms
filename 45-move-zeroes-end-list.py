# Title: Move all zeroes to end of array

# Subject: Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zeroâ€™s of a given array to the 
# end of the array. For example, if the given arrays is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, 
# it should be changed to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}. The order of all other elements 
# should be same. Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space is O(1).

# Example:
# Input :  arr[] = {1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0};
# Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0};

# Input : arr[]  = {1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6};
# Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0};
