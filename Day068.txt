Title: Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree | Set 2

Subject: Given two binary trees, check if the first tree is a subtree of the second one. A subtree of a tree T is a tree S consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T. 
The subtree corresponding to the root node is the entire tree; the subtree corresponding to any other node is called a proper subtree.

Example:
For example, in the following case, Tree1 is a subtree of Tree2. 

        Tree1
          x 
        /    \
      a       b
       \
        c


        Tree2
              z
            /   \
          x      e
        /    \     \
      a       b      k
       \
        c
