Given two strings 'str1' and 'str2', check if these two strings are isomorphic to each other.
Two strings str1 and str2 are called isomorphic if there is a one to one mapping possible for every character of str1 to every character of str2 while preserving the order.
Note: All occurrences of every character in ‘str1’ should map to the same character in ‘str2’

Example:
Input: str1 = aab, str2 = xxy
Output: 1
Explanation: There are two different charactersin aab and xxy, i.e a and b with frequency 2and 1 respectively.

Input: str1 = aab, str2 = xyz
Output: 0
Explanation: There are two different charactersin aab but there are three different charactersin xyz. So there won't be one to one mapping between str1 and str2.
