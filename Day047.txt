Title: Minimum swaps required to bring all elements less than or equal to k together

Subject: Given an array of n positive integers and a number k. Find the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal to k together. 

Example:
Input:  arr[] = {2, 1, 5, 6, 3}, k = 3
Output: 1

Explanation: 
To bring elements 2, 1, 3 together, swap 
element '5' with '3' such that final array
will be-
arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 6, 5}

Input:  arr[] = {2, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 4}, k = 5
Output: 2
