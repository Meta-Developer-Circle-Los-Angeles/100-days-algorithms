# Title: Arrange given numbers to form the biggest number | Set 1

# Subject: 
# Given an array of numbers, arrange them in a way that yields the largest 
# value. For example, if the given numbers are {54, 546, 548, 60}, the 
# arrangement 6054854654 gives the largest value. And if the given numbers 
# are {1, 34, 3, 98, 9, 76, 45, 4}, then the arrangement 998764543431 gives 
# the largest value.

# Example:
# A simple solution that comes to our mind is to sort all numbers in descending
# order, but simply sorting doesnâ€™t work. For example, 548 is greater than 60, 
# but in output 60 comes before 548. As a second example, 98 is greater than 9,
# but 9 comes before 98 in output.

# So how do we go about it? The idea is to use any comparison based sorting 
# algorithm. 
# In the used sorting algorithm, instead of using the default comparison, 
# write a comparison function myCompare() and use it to sort numbers.

# For Python, the procedure is explained in largestNumber() function.

# Given two numbers X and Y, how should myCompare() decide which number to put 
# first â€“ we compare two numbers XY (Y appended at the end of X) and YX 
# (X appended at the end of Y). If XY is larger, then X should come before Y 
# in output, else Y should come before. For example, let X and Y be 542 and 60. 
# To compare X and Y, we compare 54260 and 60542. Since 60542 is greater than 
# 54260, we put Y first.
