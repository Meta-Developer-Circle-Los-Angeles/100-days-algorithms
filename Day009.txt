Subject:
Given a string of digits, determine whether it is a ‘sum-string’. A string S is called a sum-string if a rightmost substring can be written as sum of two substrings before it and same is recursively true for substrings before it. 

Example:
Input: "12243660"
Output: is a sum string
Explanation : 24 + 36 = 60, 12 + 24 = 36

Input: “1111112223” 
Output: true, is a sum string
Explanation: 111+112 = 223, 1+111 = 112 

Input: “2368” 
Output: false, is not a sum string
